## Description
The main goal of this project is to manage the blood supply chain between blood banks and hospitals greatly. To complete this task machine learning algorithm and flask framework helps to solve this approach. By using the XGBoost algorithm I was able to generate prediction results, and by using the flask framework I was able to provide a better user experience.

## Visuals

- In the project first of all I used XGBoost model to perfom prediction task. Below image define the accuracy of the model.![prediction_output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058159/129978012-aa055fcd-cef3-40c6-86dc-9ae148c044c9.JPG)

- In the given image output define the prediction feature where admin can generate predictions as much time as blood banks need.![admin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058159/129978105-d26a5bd3-7b69-4d03-a1ca-d68f97ad706a.png)

## Usage

- After compeleting installation process with all above liberaries in the project, the web-application open in search enging which hosted at local host.
- For running the project open project files in Pycharm or any other compitable IDE to complete the task.
- After that set virtual environment in the project with using anaconda or other inbuilt IDE features. This step helps to install remaining libarires.
- Now run the project with main.py file. which execute the task on local host. localhost port number is 7892.
- Project file contain the all main file which are required.
- The final result, which will represent algorithms in a web application format, will be supplied to you in the end.

## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to my adviser Prof. Dr. T Tomesh, of MS in Computer Science department of Lakehead University, for guiding and supporting this project to complete work successfully. This is to express our heartfelt gratitude and admiration for the lecturer. 
  

## Road-map

- In the future I want to add more datasets to the current dataset along with also want to apply another algorithm of machine learning to compare the accuracy of the model each time. The purpose of this task is to provide more feasible results for blood banks.
- Another thing I want to add is the live location mapping feature, which helps the blood bank to keep track of donors or receiver records while they are reaching to blood bank or hospital. The purpose of this task is to provide an additional feature for blood banks to handle donors and receivers in an emergency. Like in an emergency if a blood bank has details of their nearby donor's location then they can easily send them a request and complete the donation task quickly rather than waiting for a person who is coming so far.  

## Project Status

- I have completed prediction task with 35000 data which include only single city of data with limited diseases. In practical there are several other diseases required blood externeally. So, if we add all diseases with many cities than result may be different but at the end it will help blood banks to manage blood accuratly if they know the total demand with all diseases. Only six diseases data is not sufficient to predict the large volume blood demand in future. 
- To that end, if anyone else is interested in the same concept as myself, I cordially encourage you to join me in this research and make the model as useful as possible.
